    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="img/face.png" alt="face">
    <p>I started my journey into programming when I was only 9 years old. Picking apart website source code and learning
      java through youtube tutorials. I was fascinated by the magic that could be achieved through code. Ever since then
      I have done as much as possible to delve deep into computer science. I spent most of my free time in high school
      reading college textbooks and writing countless programs purely for the fun of it.</p>
    <p>
      Outside of programming, I am also a competitive level 10 gymnast and avid percussionist
