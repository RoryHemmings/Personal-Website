Navigation bar with the following items

  - About

Home page should have something cool that draws attention to it
something with a really modern and nice design that has a techy feel to it
  - it should also have links to my socials, linked-in, github, email, and you know
  - I'm thinking of adding some sort of node line drawing art thing
  - It should have a box with my picture and info about me, next to an animated spinning
    3D node drawing

When you scroll down it will have layers, each of which will lead to another of the
sections of the website, however each one will have information about that section
  - For example, the first layer will be about projects, it will entise the reader
    and provide a little bit of insight into the projects, without giving away all
    of the information
  - Each page should take up the entire screen

Finally there will be a footer with all of the other relevant information

The color scheme should be dark, and revolve around black, and tasteful red
Only use bootstrap to deterine positioning and element sizes. Font's and colors will be done manually
  - In other words, only use the col-md-4 like types

modify the scrollbar

rem - relative to font size
vh - percentage of viewport height
scroll reveal 

What i need to fix

make navbar links not become vertical when it gets too small (make a sidebar)
make background image not repeat when screen gets too narrow
make all preview things stack instead of being columns


Projects Page:
use the cool animation thing as a background for the intro section
talk about the skills I have, and touch on projects
Each section of the page will have a project on it
