Navigation bar with the following items
  - Home
  - Projects
  - Contact/Freelance info
  - About

Home page should have something cool that draws attention to it
something with a really modern and nice design that has a techy feel to it
  - it should also have links to my socials, linked-in, github, email, and you know

When you scroll down it will have layers, each of which will lead to another of the
sections of the website, however each one will have information about that section
  - For example, the first layer will be about projects, it will entise the reader
    and provide a little bit of insight into the projects, without giving away all
    of the information
  - Each page should take up the entire screen

Finally there will be a footer with all of the other relevant information

The color scheme should be dark, and revolve around black, and tasteful red
